This project implemented astrocyte modulation of synaptic plasticity in liquid state machines. Phew, that's indeed a mouthful. Essentially the idea is to alter the rate of STDP implemented in these networks called LSMs (liquid state machines). STDP, spike timing dependent plasticity, is a means to change the synaptic weights between neurons in a spiking neural network based on their firing times. This rule directly derives itself from the rule of the same name in biological neuronal networks - neurons that fire together, wire together and neurons out of sync, fail to link. Astrocytes are special cells in nervous systems that are non-spiking in nature but modulate synaptic plasticity and hence play a key role in learning. In a paper by Ivanov, et.al., the idea of changing STDP rates in LSMs through an astrocyte parameter to improve accuracy was introduced. My project implemented this idea and tested performance on speech recognition with the TI-46 dataset, and subsequently with the MNIST - 784 dataset of images.
